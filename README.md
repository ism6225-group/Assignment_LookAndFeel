## Why this website?

Our website is an informative website that can help a student who wishes to be the next Business Analyst.

## How we built the website?
### Responsiveness

For the compatibility with mobile, tablet and desktop screen sizes, we used @media rule in CSS to apply different styles. The breakpoints were 600px, 900px, 1200px. This was adopted from “The 100% correct way to do CSS breakpoints” article.
### Usability

We built this website based on the landing page marketing concept, so visitors have one goal to achieve in each page “Call to action” button. The goal is to learn more about business analytics. In addition, each page encourages the visitor to learn more by giving a brief description and “Learn more” button. The navigation bar links other pages such as About US, Glossary, and GitHub. Those pages’ links are hidden in the mobile screen for simplicity and visitors could scroll down to the footer for those pages.
### Content

Our website focuses on the skills and area that any business analyst should consider while pursuing her/his journey. The quickly going through our content. Our content has been updated with the latest information and we have provided useful reference links.

We focused upon the different topics like Business Analysis, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Artificial Intelligence and their scopes. We even provided a useful link which directs them to the University of South Florida Business Analytics Program. In addition, we provided the a small glossary to refer in case of jargons.
### Design

In this website, we used CSS variables to define the main five colors of the website. We used a custom font called “OpenSans” that was adopted from Google Fonts. This font has been in different weights i.e. 300, 400, 600, and 700. We used transition effects in buttons and cards. The design guidelines and ideas were adopted from “Argon Design System”.

Some of the design guidelines:
- Key CTAs are visible and clear.
- Click title always leads you to homepage.
- The site is search visible and social media friendly using meta tags.
